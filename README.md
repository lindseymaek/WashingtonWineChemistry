# WashingtonWineChemistry

WaWineChem.txt is a dataset of Washington State wine chemistry data curated from self-published winery sources. Wineries commonly publish information about available vintages in the form of "technical sheets" for the interested consumer. When this project was started in Fall 2020, a centralized location for these publicly-available Washington wine data did not exist. Vintage compositional data is useful for tracking trends in the wine industry. 

The dataset by column:
1) identifier - number indicating position in the dataset
2) variety - only single red bordeaux varietal wines or blends containing 20\% or less of a non-Bordeaux Variety. Red Bordeaux variety wines, for the purpose of these data were restricted to Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot
3) winery - wineries included in this dataset were selected purely out of researcher recognition, and while not entirely random, were not chosen for promotional purposes nor bias towards particular compositional values
4) AVA - American Viticultural Area. Only Eastern Washington AVAs as were recognized at the time of the wine bottlings are reported and may not be as specific as is currently recognized.
5) vintage - year of harvest and production. Multi-vintage products will not be included in this dataset.
6) pH
7) titratableAcidity - reported in grams per Liter. The standard in the United States is to use tartaric acid equivalents and a titration endpoint of pH 8.2. The particulars of this measurement practice regarding these data have not been verified with any winery.
8) ethanol - ethanol concentration reported in \%v/v
9) wineID - memo containing other identifying information about the wine such as the name
10) collectionYear - year of the data collection. It is the objective of WashingtonWineChemistry repository that data will be added on a yearly basis
11) sourceDomain - original website of the winery reporting the data. Furthermore, the web pages or technical sheets, where available are also available for viewing under the WashingtonWineChemistry/source/2020/pdf
