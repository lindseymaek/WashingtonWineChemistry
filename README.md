# WashingtonWineChemistry
WAWineChem database of Washington State wine chemistry data curated from self-published winery sources. When this project was started in Fall 2020, a centralized location for these publicly-available data did not exist. Vintage compositional data is useful for tracking trends in the wine industry. These data include wines only from Eastern Washington AVAs that are single Bordeaux Varieties or blends containing 20\% or less of a non-Bordeaux Variety. Wineries included in this dataset were selected purely out of researcher recognition, and while not entirely random, were not chosen for promotional purposes nor for selection of particular data values. 

The dataset includes 1) identifier, or number indicating position in the database \par
 2) variety \par
  3) winery 4)
